# Dan's Homework Portfolio Challenge

This challenge had me create a portfolio for myself that I can eventually use to display the work that I create throughout this Bootcamp! The portfolio includes the following:
- About Me section complete with a profile photo and functional navigation links.
- An About Me section.
- 5 images that act as links to my first HW assignment.
- A Contact Me section with functional navigation links.
